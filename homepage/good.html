                        Hey, I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Alberta. I'm passionate about Object Oriented software development. I love learning about how to write super flexible and extenisble code. I enjoy backend development in high level languages. You can check out some of the projects I've worked on <a href="https://github.com/gantonious">here</a>.

                                At DevFacto I developed an Android Application from scratch with zero experience in Android development. I learned most of my Android knowledge by reading tutorials online. <a href="https://guides.codepath.com/android">Codepath</a> has fantastic tutorials about different phases of android development and library usage. I also helped work our applications backend services. We used ASP.NET WebApi to develop our backend services.

                            I have experienced utilizing ReactiveX to build reactive applications. Using ReactiveX has allowed me to gain a better sense of functional programming patterns, and when it makes sense to approaching a problem functionaly.
